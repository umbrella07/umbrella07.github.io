    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>The mystery black box is a box that has a funnel on the top and a tube at the bottom. I believe that on the inside of the box is a tipping bucket as the main component.

    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>I believe that inside the mystery black box is a tipping bucket. At times the bucket had an input of 500 mL and an output of 0.  Then on other trials the mystery black box had an imput of 500 and an output of 1,915. It can be any number for the output so it is very unpredictable on what is on the inside.
